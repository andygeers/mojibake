== English ==

Mojibake in English texts generally occurs in punctuation, such as em
dashes (—), en dashes (–), and curly quotes (“, ”), but rarely in
character text, since most encodings agree with ASCII on the encoding
of the English alphabet. For example, the pound sign "£" will appear
as "Â£" if it was encoded by the sender as UTF-8 but interpreted by
the recipient as CP1252 or ISO 8859-1. If iterated, this can lead to
"Ã‚Â£", "Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£", etc.
