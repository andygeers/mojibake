== Description

Mojibake occurs in English most frequently due to misinterpreting and
bad-transcoding between Windows-1252, ISO-8859-1, and UTF-8. This
module provides a mojibake sequence to original character mapping
table, and utility to recover mojibake’d text.

Testing has been with English but other Latin based languages, where
Windows-1252 is in the wild, should also benefit.

== Dependencies

Mojibake mappings generation requires the String encoding support in
ruby 1.9 as provided by:

*  ruby >= 1.9.2 (tested 1.9.2p290, 1.9.3p392, 2.0.0p247 Linux)
* jruby ~> 1.6.5 or ~> 1.7.5 (tested 1.6.8, 1.7.5 Linux)
* rubinius >= 2.0.0 (tested via Travis CI)

Note: jruby versions 1.7.0-1.7.4 have various encoding support
regressions. Recovery of text with default settings is supported by
using the pre-generated table.json when in ruby 1.8 mode, or for other
jruby versions.

== Synopsis

 gem install mojibake

 require 'mojibake'
 mapper = MojiBake::Mapper.new
 mapper.recover( 'â€œquotedâ€�' ) #=> '“quoted”'

Or via cli:

 mojibake -h

List the mojibake mapping table (output in UTF-8):

 mojibake -t

Recover from a text file:

 mojibake input.txt
